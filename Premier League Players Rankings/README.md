# Premier League 2019-2020 Rankings

I used the data from Premier League 2018-2019 to train 4 separate models for each of defenders, midfielders, forwards and goalkeepers and then used 2019-2020 statistics to find out the rankings of the players based on their performance this season. In the jupyter notebook given, the model was only experimented on goalkeepers and the final result is given as an image in this folder as well. It can also be found below:
